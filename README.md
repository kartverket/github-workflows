# github-workflows

Shared reusable workflows for GitHub Actions

## run-terraform

This workflow plans and applies terraform config to deploy to an environment.

The code extract below shows two job, one which enables us to reuse variables, and one which enables us to run terraform through the reusable workflow.
Note that the setup-env job is required in order to pass values into the reusable workflow, since reusable workflows do not yet support fetching environment variables as input.

```yaml
env:
  WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_FEDERATION_PROVIDER: X
  WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_FEDERATION_SERVICE_ACCOUNT: X
  PROJECT_ID: X

  setup-env:

    outputs:
      workload_identity_provider: ${{ steps.set-output.outputs.workload_identity_provider }}

      project_id: ${{ steps.set-output.outputs.project_id }}
    steps:
      - name: set outputs with default values

| workload_identity_provider | string | X        | The ID of the provider to use for authentication. It should be in the format of `projects/{{project}}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{{workload_identity_pool_id}}/providers/{{workload_identity_pool_provider_id}}`   |
| service_account            | string | X        | The GCP service account connected to the identity pool that will be used by Terraform.                                                                                                                                         |
| runner                     | string | X        | The GitHub runner to use when running the deploy. This can for example be `atkv1-dev`.                                                                                                                                         |
