# github-workflows

Shared reusable workflows for GitHub Actions

## run-terraform

This workflow plans and applies Terraform config to deploy to an environment.

### Features

- Logs in to GCP, Kubernetes and Vault automatically with [Workload Identity Federation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect)
- Posts comments with relevant information to Pull Requests
- Runs validate, format and plan to verify deployment follows conventions before running apply
- Posts summaries on relevant steps on the Action pipeline view to improve visibility
- Supports manual approval and delay periods in deploy using  [GitHub Environments protection rules](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#environment-protection-rules)
- Re-uses plan from plan step in apply step to ensure apply always executes the diff generated by plan no matter when it is run
- Prevents deploys running in parallel against the same environment crashing due to failing to aquire state lock
- Allows for the choice of deploying and/or destroying terraform config
- Performs binary attestation on the image if proivided. Note that for an image to be used in the test and prod environments (i.e. test and prod kubernetes clusters) it will need to be attested in this manner.

### Example

```yaml
jobs:
  dev:
    name: Deploy to dev
    permissions:
      # For logging on to Vault, GCP
      id-token: write
      # For writing comments on PR
      pull-requests: write
      # For fetching git repo
      contents: read
    uses: kartverket/github-workflows/.github/workflows/run-terraform.yml@<latest release>
    with:
      runner: atkv1-dev
      environment: dev
      kubernetes_cluster: atkv1-dev
      terraform_workspace: dev
      terraform_options: -var-file=dev.tfvars
      working_directory: terraform
      workload_identity_provider: X
      service_account: X
      project_id: X
      image_url: <registry>/<repository>:<tag>
      bucket: <optional to declare here>
      deploy: <optional>
      destroy: <optional>
```

### Passing env vars to run-terraform

Passing environment variables to reusable workflows is not supported by GitHub.
This is a [requested feature](https://github.community/t/passing-environment-variables-to-reusable-workflow/230456/4).
The current workaround for this is to use a setup-job to consume env vars and
provide an output that can be mapped to the arguments of the job.

  WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_FEDERATION_PROVIDER: X

### Passing secrets to run-terraform

Secrets should be administered through vault and thus there is no explicit
support for taking GitHub secrets into the action. GitHub will also stop you
from sending secrets as arguments using the `with` argument, so this will not
work either.

Use the [vault_generic_secret](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/vault/latest/docs/data-sources/generic_secret)
Terraform data source along with the `vault_role` argument to run-terraform to
fetch secrets required at deploy-time.

Each repo needs its own unique `vault_role`. Contact SKIP if you do not have
this role.

## post-build-attest

This workflow performs binary attestation on a built image. 
Note the format of the image_url parameter. 

### Features

- Logs in to GCP automatically with [Workload Identity Federation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect)
- Performs binary attestation on the image. Attests (1) that the image was built in context of Kartverket and (2) that the image is on main/master branch.

### Example

```yaml
jobs:
  build: 
    ...

  auth-attest:
    needs: [build]
    name: Authentication and Attestation
    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: write
      # required for authentication to GCP
      id-token: write
      actions: read
      security-events: write
      statuses: write
