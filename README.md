# Reusable Workflows

We currently have 4 reusable workflows (i.e. [run-terraform](#run-terraform) and [run-security-scans (DEPRECATED)](#run-security-scans)) available for use.

See [Ideal Use of Workflows](#ideal-use-of-reusable-workflows) for an example of how to optimally use all 3 workflows together.

See [Tips and Tricks](#tips-and-tricks) for supporting information regarding usage of the reusable workflows.

## run-kubectl

Allows running kubectl commands against a Kubernetes cluster. This is useful for doing restarts of deployments for example.


### Features

- Connects to a google cluster as a deploy service account
- Will always use connect gateway
- Runs specified kubectl commands against the cluster

### Requirements

- Your gcp project is set up and given required permissions in skip-core-infrastructure and gcp-service-accounts


### Example

Example usage in `.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml`:
```yaml
name: Restart deployment
on: pull_request_target

jobs:
  sandbox:
    name: restart-app
    uses: kartverket/github-workflows/.github/workflows/run-kubectl.yaml@latest
    with:
      cluster_name: atkv1-dev
      service_account: mygcp-project-deploy@mygcp-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
      kubernetes_project_id: kube-dev-4329023
      kubernetes_project_number: 43290432893
      command: restart deployment my-deployment
      namespace: default
```

## auto-merge-dependabot

Allows auto-merging dependabot PRs that match given patterns. Useful when you are drowning in PRs and have built up trust in a set of dependencies that release often and never break. It's recommended to have a sane CI setup so that anything merged to main at least passes CI tests before going into prod

### Features

- Allows configuring a set of dependencies in a configfile that can be merged
- Each dependency will allow either major, minor or patch updates (only supports semver)
- A bot approves and merges the PR

### Requirements

A few requirements are necessary in order to make this work in addition to the example below. 

1. Legacy branch protection rules are not supported. Your repo needs to use the more modern branch rulesets
2. The Octo STS app needs to be added to the rulesets bypass list so that it can merge the PR
3. A trust file called `.github/chainguard/auto-update.sts.yaml` needs to exist to allow the workflow to get a valid GitHub token

### Example

Example usage in `.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml`:
```yaml
name: Dependabot auto-merge
on: pull_request_target

jobs:
  auto-merge-dependabot:
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
    uses: kartverket/github-workflows/.github/workflows/auto-merge-dependabot.yml@<release tag>
```

Example configfile in `.github/auto-update.json`:
```json
[{
  "match": {
    "dependency_name": "hashicorp/google",
    "update_type": "semver:minor"
  }
}, {
  "match": {
    "dependency_name": "hashicorp/google-beta",
    "update_type": "semver:minor"
  }
}]
```

Example STS trust file in `.github/chainguard/auto-update.sts.yaml`:
```yaml
issuer: https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
subject: repo:kartverket/gcp-service-accounts:pull_request

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull_requests: write
```

### Inputs

The configfile is currently the only input. The configfile at `.github/auto-merge.json` supports the following values:

| Key                        | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                |
|----------------------------|--------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `[].match.dependency_name` | string | true     | The name of the dependency as it appears on the Dependabot PR                                                                                                                              |
| `[].match.update_type`     | string | true     | Which changes should be merged. Currently supports `semver:patch`, `semver:minor` and `semver:major`. The type includes all lower tiers, for example `semver:minor` includes patch changes |

## run-terraform

This workflow plans and applies Terraform config to deploy to an environment.

### Features

- Logs in to GCP and Kubernetes automatically with [Workload Identity Federation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect)
- Posts comments with relevant information to Pull Requests
- Runs validate, format and plan to verify deployment follows conventions before running apply
- Posts summaries on relevant steps on the Action pipeline view to improve visibility
- Supports manual approval and delay periods in deploy using [GitHub Environments protection rules](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#environment-protection-rules)
- Re-uses plan from plan step in apply step to ensure apply always executes the diff generated by plan no matter when it is run
- Prevents deploys running in parallel against the same environment crashing due to failing to acquire state lock
- Allows for the choice of deploying and/or destroying terraform config
- Will only deploy on push or workflow_dispatch event to main by default. Can be configured to deploy on a different branch using the `deploy_on` input.

### Example

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
  # Builds an image of the format <registry>/<repository>:<tag> or <registry>/<repository>@<digest>
  # and pushes it to the github registry.
  # See 'All Workflows Together' section for an example build job.

  dev:
    needs: [build]

## run-security-scans

### _DEPRECATED: THIS WORKFLOW IS DEPRECATED AND WILL NOT RECEIVE FURTHER UPDATES. PLEASE CHECK OUT [Pharos](https://github.com/kartverket/pharos/) FOR SECURITY SCANS_

This workflow runs security scans on a repository.
Note, in order to not limit/interfere with the development process, the scans do not run on draft pull requests.
Additionally, if image_url is not supplied Trivy scan will not be performed (i.e. only TFSec scan will run).

### Features

- Runs TFSec, a static analysis security scanner for your Terraform code. Does not run on draft pull requests.
- Runs Trivy, a comprehensive security scanner. Does not run on draft pull requests.
- Calls the GitHub Security Code Scanning API and fails workflow if there are any _high_ or _critical_ errors.
- The above step can be configured by specifying the `allow_severity_level` input parameter.

### Requirements

- Code Scanning must be appropriately set up in the Github Security tab.
- Note that the image built during your build-job must be pushed to the registry on all but draft PRs for the workflow to work as intended (see example build job below, paying extra attention to lines following `# Note: ...`)

### Example

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    # Builds an image of the format <registry>/<repository>:<tag> or <registry>/<repository>@<digest>
  # and pushes it to the github registry. This is the image that must be used in all following jobs.
  # See 'All Workflows Together' section for an example build job.

# Example Usage

Below are examples of how to use the reusable workflows for different scenarios

## Ideal Use of Reusable Workflows

The following is an example of how to use run-terraform and run-security-scans together to deploy to dev, test and prod environments.
Note the use of `jobs.<job_id>.needs` to specify the order in which jobs run.
For details on how to use `jobs.<job_id>.outputs` see [Using outputs](#using-outputs).

```yaml
name: "Ideal" workflow

# The workflow runs when (1) there is a push to the 'main' branch or (2) there is a push to a pull request onto main branch
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

## Deploy on workflow dispatch

If you want to deploy a selected branch to the dev-environment on workflow dispatch.
You will need to take care not to interfere with others working in the same repo/environment.
Note that the `deploy_on` input is set to `${{ github.ref }}` and that the only `on` specified is `workflow_dispatch`

```yaml
name: Deploy to dev on workflow dispatch
on: workflow_dispatch

jobs:
  build:
    # Builds an image of the format <registry>/<repository>:<tag> or <registry>/<repository>@<digest>
    # and pushes it to the github registry. This is the image that must be used in all following jobs.
    # See 'Using outputs' section for suggestions on how to do this.

  security-scans:
    needs: [build]
    # call to run-security-scans.yml with build image

  dev:
    name: Deploy to dev
    needs: [security-scans]
    permissions:
      # For logging on to Vault, GCP
      id-token: write
      # For writing comments on PR
      pull-requests: write
      # For fetching git repo
      contents: read
      # For accessing repository
      packages: write
    uses: kartverket/github-workflows/.github/workflows/run-terraform.yml@<release tag>
    with:
      runner: ubuntu-latest
      environment: dev
      kubernetes_cluster: atkv1-dev
      terraform_workspace: dev
      terraform_option_1: -var-file=dev.tfvars -var=image=${{ needs.build.outputs.image_url}}
      terraform_init_option_1: -backend-config=dev.gcs.tfbackend
      working_directory: terraform
      auth_project_number: "123456789123"
      service_account: sa-name@project-dev-123.iam.gserviceaccount.com
      project_id: project-dev-123
      deploy_on: ${{ github.ref }}
```

# Tips and Tricks

Helpful "tips and tricks" for using the reusable workflows can be found below.

## Using needs

If you want jobs to run in a particular order:

> Use `jobs.<job_id>.needs` to identify any jobs that must complete successfully before this job will run. [[2](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idneeds)]

See [Github Doc: jobs.<job_id>.needs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idneeds)

## Using outputs

If you want to use outputs from one job in some following job:

> You can use `jobs.<job_id>.outputs` to create a map of outputs for a job. Job outputs are available to all downstream jobs that depend on this job. [[1](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/defining-outputs-for-jobs)]

See [Github Doc: Defining outputs for jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/defining-outputs-for-jobs) for more information.

## Passing env vars to reusable workflows

If you want to use environment variables, passing them to a reusable workflow is
a little tricky as this behavior is not currently supported by GitHub.
This is a [requested feature](https://github.community/t/passing-environment-variables-to-reusable-workflow/230456/4).
The current workaround for this is to use a setup-job to consume env vars and
provide an output that can be mapped to the arguments of the job.

## Passing secrets to reusable workflows

Secrets should be administered through Google Secret Manager and thus there is no explicit
support for taking GitHub secrets into the action. GitHub will also stop you
from sending secrets as arguments using the `with` argument, so this will not
work either.
