# github-workflows

Shared reusable workflows for GitHub Actions

## run-terraform

This workflow plans and applies Terraform config to deploy to an environment.

### Features

- Logs in to GCP, Kubernetes and Vault automatically with [Workload Identity Federation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect)
- Posts comments with relevant information to Pull Requests
- Runs validate, format and plan to verify deployment follows conventions before running apply
- Posts summaries on relevant steps on the Action pipeline view to improve visibility
- Supports manual approval and delay periods in deploy using [GitHub Environments protection rules](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#environment-protection-rules)
- Re-uses plan from plan step in apply step to ensure apply always executes the diff generated by plan no matter when it is run
- Prevents deploys running in parallel against the same environment crashing due to failing to aquire state lock
- Allows for the choice of deploying and/or destroying terraform config
- Performs binary attestation on the image if proivided. Note that for an image to be used in the test and prod environments (i.e. test and prod kubernetes clusters) it will need to be attested in this manner.

### Example

```yaml
jobs:
  build: 
  # ...

  post-build-attest:
    # call to post-build-attest.yml with build image

  dev:
    name: Deploy to dev
    permissions:
      # For logging on to Vault, GCP
      id-token: write
      # For writing comments on PR
      pull-requests: write
      # For fetching git repo
      contents: read
    uses: kartverket/github-workflows/.github/workflows/run-terraform.yml@<release tag>
    with:
      runner: atkv1-dev
      environment: dev
      kubernetes_cluster: atkv1-dev
      terraform_workspace: dev
      terraform_option_1: -var-file=dev.tfvars
      terraform_init_option_1: -backend-config=dev.gcs.tfbackend
      working_directory: terraform
      auth_project_number: "123456789123"
      service_account: X
      project_id: X
      image_url: <registry>/<repository>:<tag> or <registry>/<repository>@<digest>
      destroy: <optional boolean>
```

### Passing env vars to run-terraform

Passing environment variables to reusable workflows is not supported by GitHub.
This is a [requested feature](https://github.community/t/passing-environment-variables-to-reusable-workflow/230456/4).
The current workaround for this is to use a setup-job to consume env vars and
provide an output that can be mapped to the arguments of the job.

### Passing secrets to run-terraform

Secrets should be administered through vault and thus there is no explicit
support for taking GitHub secrets into the action. GitHub will also stop you
from sending secrets as arguments using the `with` argument, so this will not
work either.

Use the [vault_generic_secret](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/vault/latest/docs/data-sources/generic_secret)
Terraform data source along with the `vault_role` argument to run-terraform to
fetch secrets required at deploy-time.

Each repo needs its own unique `vault_role`. Contact SKIP if you do not have
this role.

## post-build-attest

This workflow performs binary attestation on a built image.
Note the format of the image_url parameter.

### Features

- Logs in to GCP automatically with [Workload Identity Federation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect)
- Performs binary attestation on the image. Attests (1) that the image was built in context of Kartverket and (2) that the image is on main/master branch.

### Example

```yaml
jobs:
  build: 
  # ...

  post-build-attest:
    needs: [build]
    name: Authentication and Attestation of Build
    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: write
      # required for authentication to GCP
      id-token: write
      actions: read
      security-events: write
      statuses: write
    uses: kartverket/github-workflows/.github/workflows/post-build-attest.yml@<release tag>
    with:
      auth_project_number: "123456789321"
      service_account: x
      image_url: ${{ needs.build.outputs.image_url }} # the image created by build job
```

## run-security-scans

This workflow runs security scans and performs binary attestation if no _high_ or _critical_ vulnerabilities are found.
Note, in order to not limit/interfere with the developement process, the scans do not run on draft pull requests. 
Additionally, if image_url is not supplied neither Trivy nor Binary Attestation will be performed (i.e. only TFSec scan will run).

### Features

- Runs TFSec, a static analysis security scanner for your Terraform code. Does not run on draft pull requests.
- Runs Trivy, a comprehensive security scanner. Does not run on draft pull requests.
- Creates a binary attestation on the supplied image if trivy is run.
- Calls the Github Security Code Scanning API and fails with exit code 1 if there are any _high_ or _critical_ errors.
- Creates a binary attestation on the supplied image if both TFsec and Trivy scans are run and there are no _high_ or _critical_ errors in Github Security Code Scanning.

### Requirements

- Code Scanning must be appropriatly set up in the Github Security tab.
- Note that the image built during your build-job must be pushed to the registry on all but draft PRs for the workflow to work as intended (see example build job below, paying extra attention to lines following `# Note: ...`)

### Example

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    # Example of how to build an image and supply appropriate inputs to run-security-scans reusable workflow
    # Note outputs derived in the setOutput step and 'tags' set in the meta step
    name: Build Docker Image
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:

      image_tag_url: ${{ steps.setOutput.outputs.image_tag_url }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Sets tag 'latest' for images built on main/master branch and tag 'prebuild-temp' on all other image builds
      - name: Set tag
        id: set-tag
        env:
          BRANCH: ${{ github.ref_name }}
        run: |
          if [[ "$BRANCH" == "main" || "$BRANCH" == "master" ]]; then
            echo "image_tag=latest" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          else
            echo "image_tag=prebuild-temp" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          fi
