# Reusable Workflows

We currently have 3 reusable workflows (i.e. [run-terraform](#run-terraform), [post-build-attest](#post-build-attest) and [run-security-scans](#run-security-scans)) available for use.

See [Ideal Use of Workflows](#ideal-use-of-reusable-workflows) for an example of how to optimally use all 3 workflows together.

See [Tips and Tricks](#tips-and-tricks) for supporting information regarding usage of the reusable workflows.

## post-build-attest

This workflow performs binary attestation on a built image.

### Features

- Logs in to GCP automatically with [Workload Identity Federation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect)
- Performs binary attestation on the image. Attests (1) that the image was built in context of Kartverket and (2) that the image is on main/master branch.

### Example

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
  # Builds an image of the format <registry>/<repository>:<tag> or <registry>/<repository>@<digest>
  # and pushes it to the github registry. This is the image that must be used in all following jobs.
  # See 'All Workflows Together' section for an example build job.

  post-build-attest:
    needs: [build]
    name: Authentication and Attestation of Build
    permissions:
      # For fetching git repo
      contents: read
      # For accessing repository
      packages: write
      # required for authentication to GCP
      id-token: write
      actions: read
      security-events: write
      statuses: write
    uses: kartverket/github-workflows/.github/workflows/post-build-attest.yml@<release tag>
    with:
      auth_project_number: "123456789321"
      service_account: sa-name@project-dev-123.iam.gserviceaccount.com
      image_url: <registry>/<repository>:<tag> or <registry>/<repository>@<digest> # the image created by build job
```

## run-terraform

This workflow plans and applies Terraform config to deploy to an environment.

### Features

- Logs in to GCP, Kubernetes and Vault automatically with [Workload Identity Federation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect)
- Posts comments with relevant information to Pull Requests
- Runs validate, format and plan to verify deployment follows conventions before running apply
- Posts summaries on relevant steps on the Action pipeline view to improve visibility
- Supports manual approval and delay periods in deploy using [GitHub Environments protection rules](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#environment-protection-rules)
- Re-uses plan from plan step in apply step to ensure apply always executes the diff generated by plan no matter when it is run
- Prevents deploys running in parallel against the same environment crashing due to failing to aquire state lock
- Allows for the choice of deploying and/or destroying terraform config
- Performs binary attestation on the image if proivided. Note that for an image to be used in the test and prod environments (i.e. test and prod kubernetes clusters) it will need to be attested in this manner.
- Will only deploy on push or workflow_dispatch event to main by default. Can be configured to deploy on a different branch using the `deploy_on` input.

### Example

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
  # Builds an image of the format <registry>/<repository>:<tag> or <registry>/<repository>@<digest>
  # and pushes it to the github registry. This is the image that must be used in all following jobs.
  # See 'All Workflows Together' section for an example build job.

## run-security-scans

This workflow runs security scans and performs binary attestation if no _high_ or _critical_ vulnerabilities are found.
Note, in order to not limit/interfere with the developement process, the scans do not run on draft pull requests.
Additionally, if image_url is not supplied neither Trivy nor Binary Attestation will be performed (i.e. only TFSec scan will run).

### Features

- Runs TFSec, a static analysis security scanner for your Terraform code. Does not run on draft pull requests.
- Runs Trivy, a comprehensive security scanner. Does not run on draft pull requests.
- Creates a binary attestation on the supplied image if trivy is run.
- Calls the Github Security Code Scanning API and fails with exit code 1 if there are any _high_ or _critical_ errors.
- Creates a binary attestation on the supplied image if both TFsec and Trivy scans are run and there are no _high_ or _critical_ errors in Github Security Code Scanning.

### Requirements

- Code Scanning must be appropriatly set up in the Github Security tab.
- Note that the image built during your build-job must be pushed to the registry on all but draft PRs for the workflow to work as intended (see example build job below, paying extra attention to lines following `# Note: ...`)

### Example

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    # Builds an image of the format <registry>/<repository>:<tag> or <registry>/<repository>@<digest>
  # and pushes it to the github registry. This is the image that must be used in all following jobs.
  # See 'All Workflows Together' section for an example build job.

  post-build-attest:
    needs: [build]
    # call to post-build-attest.yml with build image

  security-scans:
    needs: [build]
    name: Security Scans
    permissions:
      # For fetching git repo
      contents: read
      # For accessing repository
      packages: write
      # required for authentication to GCP
      id-token: write
      actions: read
      security-events: write
    uses: kartverket/github-workflows/.github/workflows/run-security-scans.yml@<release tag>
    with:
      auth_project_number: "123456789123"
      service_account: sa-name@project-dev-123.iam.gserviceaccount.com
      image_url: <registry>/<repository>:<tag> or <registry>/<repository>@<digest> # the image created by build job
      trivy: <optional>
      tfsec: <optional>

  dev:
    needs: [build]
    # call to run-terraform.yml for dev environment with build image

  test:
    needs: [build, dev]
    # call to run-terraform.yml for test environment with build image

  prod:
    needs: [build, dev, test, post-build-attest, security-scans]
    # call to run-terraform.yml for prod environment only after security-scans job, with build image

# Example Usage

Below are examples of how to use the reusable workflows for different scenarios

## Ideal Use of Reusable Workflows

The following is an example of how to use run-terraform, run-security-scans and post-build-attest together to deploy to dev, test and prod environments.
Note the use of `jobs.<job_id>.needs` to specify the order in which jobs run.
For details on how to use `jobs.<job_id>.outputs` see [Using outputs](#using-outputs).

```yaml

## Deploy on workflow dispatch

If you want to deploy a selected branch to the dev-environment on workflow dispatch.
You will need to take care not to interfere with others working in the same repo/environment.
Note that the `deploy_on` input is set to `${{ github.ref }}` and that the only `on` specified is `workflow_dispatch`

```yaml
name: Deploy to dev on workflow dispatch
on: workflow_dispatch

jobs:
  build:
    # Builds an image of the format <registry>/<repository>:<tag> or <registry>/<repository>@<digest>
    # and pushes it to the github registry. This is the image that must be used in all following jobs.
    # See 'Using outputs' section for suggestions on how to do this.

  post-build-attest:
    needs: [build]
    # call to post-build-attest.yml with build image

  security-scans:
    needs: [build]
    # call to run-security-scans.yml with build image

  dev:
    name: Deploy to dev
    needs: [build]
    permissions:
      # For logging on to Vault, GCP
      id-token: write
      # For writing comments on PR
      pull-requests: write
      # For fetching git repo
      contents: read
      # For accessing repository
      packages: write
    uses: kartverket/github-workflows/.github/workflows/run-terraform.yml@<release tag>
    with:
      runner: ubuntu-latest
      environment: dev
      kubernetes_cluster: atkv1-dev
      terraform_workspace: dev
      terraform_option_1: -var-file=dev.tfvars -var=image=${{ needs.build.outputs.image_tag_url}} # the image created by the build job
      terraform_init_option_1: -backend-config=dev.gcs.tfbackend
      working_directory: terraform
      auth_project_number: "123456789123"
      service_account: sa-name@project-dev-123.iam.gserviceaccount.com
      project_id: project-dev-123
      image_url: ${{ needs.build.outputs.image_tag_url}} # the image created by the build job
      deploy_on: ${{ github.ref }}
```

# Tips and Tricks

Helpful "tips and tricks" for using the reusable workflows can be found below.

## Using needs

If you want jobs to run in a particular order:

> Use `jobs.<job_id>.needs` to identify any jobs that must complete successfully before this job will run. [[2](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idneeds)]

See [Github Doc: jobs.<job_id>.needs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idneeds)

## Using outputs

If you want to use outputs from one job in some following job:

> You can use `jobs.<job_id>.outputs` to create a map of outputs for a job. Job outputs are available to all downstream jobs that depend on this job. [[1](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/defining-outputs-for-jobs)]

See [Github Doc: Defining outputs for jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/defining-outputs-for-jobs) for more information.

## Passing env vars to reusable workflows

If you want to use environment variables, passing them to a reusable workflow is
a little tricky as this behavior is not currently supported by GitHub.
This is a [requested feature](https://github.community/t/passing-environment-variables-to-reusable-workflow/230456/4).
The current workaround for this is to use a setup-job to consume env vars and
provide an output that can be mapped to the arguments of the job.

      image_url: <registry>/<repository>:<tag> or <registry>/<repository>@<digest> # the image created by the build job
</details>
<br />

## Passing secrets to reusable workflows

Secrets should be administered through vault and thus there is no explicit
support for taking GitHub secrets into the action. GitHub will also stop you
from sending secrets as arguments using the `with` argument, so this will not
work either.

Use the [vault_generic_secret](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/vault/latest/docs/data-sources/generic_secret)
Terraform data source along with the `vault_role` argument to run-terraform to
fetch secrets required at deploy-time.

Each repo needs its own unique `vault_role`. Contact SKIP if you do not have
this role.
